       " 'review': \"This camera is a full featured entry level DSLR - if you are a seasoned pro you'll want to go with one of the pricier models, but if you are new to DSLR cameras and are looking to step up from a point and shoot camera to something much more powerful, this is a fine first step. \\nThis camera gives you full control over most parameters of your photography, but includes a broad spectrum of presets and automation as well that lets you work your way up to using all the manual tools - if you are a beginner, this camera will carry you for a few years before you begin chafing for something a bit more substantial!\\nThe camera body is light and solidly built - all the controls are accessible via buttons on the exterior of the camera as well as through an easily navigable menu. The view screen is generous and bright, easily readable in most settings. The camera also offers a viewfinder which is very helpful when shooting in high glare settings (or when you forget to bring your glasses with you!) \\nThe included lenses cover a good range of distances, but you may want to invest in a wide angle lens - a good 12-20mm for getting more into your images (although most of the better ones out there will actually cost more than your camera did). The 75-300mm zoom lens will get you in close to many subjects, but don't expect it to compete with some of those 80x zooms you see on point and shoot cameras! \\nChanging out lenses is easy and fast.\\nThere are ample settings for one shot, continuous shot, and timed delay shooting, so if you are shooting an active event you can get some great movement shots, and if you want to get into the picture yourself, its easy to do. When shooting in continuous mode, the camera will pause after five shots to let the data catch up - I've found that three shots is the gets keeps me from getting that delay.\\nBoth of these lenses shoot a little on the slow side. There is a slight hesitation after pressing the shutter release. I've also noticed that although the 18-55mm kit lens is equipped with an anti-shake feature, it really doesn't do much. So - consider adding a tripod to your purchase too!\\nThe picture quality is excellent - I always shoot in RAW and this camera offers six RAW quality settings and the same for JPEG. Or you can choose to shoot both simultaneously if you don't know a lot about the formats and want to learn. Its great to have both formats to do side by side comparisons. \\nThis camera does not have an infrared sensor, so if you wish to use a remote, you'll have to use the Canon Camera Connect mobile app - it is available for both IOS and Android devices (sadly not for Windows 10 mobile devices though!). In addition to letting you control your camera remotely, the mobile apps also let you view the pictures on your camera on the bigger screens of your smartphone (I use my iPad - and its great to see a real time image for composition on that screen - believe me!) The app is pretty easy to use and so far I've found it to be stable and reliable, although more so on my iPad than on my Android phone. \\nThis camera is also capable of shooting HD movies and that is a terrific feature - but keep in mind, you'll have to master your lenses in order to stay in focus and do efficient zooms and pans. \\nOverall this is a great camera. Canon lenses can be used on all their DSLR's, so when you are ready to upgrade to a more professional camera back, you'll be able to keep your lens kit and accessories.\",\n",
